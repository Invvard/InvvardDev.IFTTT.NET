# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to IFTTT.NET. It's people like you that make IFTTT.NET a great tool and, for open source in general, the best tool for sharing knowledge and skills.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect my time as the developer managing and developing this open source project. In return, I should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Any contribution is very much welcome and will improve the toolkit for the community. Whether it be fixing typpos ;), sharing tutorials, improving documentation, submitting issues, requesting features or, of course, writing code, I'll be more than happy to be on the receiving end!

If you do want to get involved but don't know where to start, you can check this website: [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/). 

One thing I'd like to avoid: please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions.\
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) is a much better platform for this, and if you [tag me or poke me on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1538048/invvard), I'll be glad to give you a hand.

I'll leave the basic rules here for now.\
Thank you for considering contributing, whether you go forward or not!
